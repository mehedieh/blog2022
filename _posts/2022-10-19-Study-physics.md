# Physics Self Study

The usual process of learning physics at the university level is to do 3 passes through each area, each time going to more depth and mathematical sophistication.

## Undergraduate Years 1-2
The usual process of learning physics is to first learn basics in a year and a half long course that covers the basics of a broad range of physics topics using calculus-based methods. The first year would cover classical physics topics such as mechanics, electromagnetics, waves, thermodynamics and optics. Another half year would be spent on introducing modern physics such as special relativity and quantum mechanics.

Usually this is taught out of a single, large, textbook such as "Fundamentals of Physics with Modern Physics" by Halliday and Resnick or "University Physics with Modern Physics" by Young and Freedman. Sometimes the modern physics is taught from a different text such as one of the "Modern Physics" texts by Krane, Tipler or Harris.

Sometimes universities offer honors courses which provide a faster-paced introduction. The textbook "An Introduction to Classical Mechanics" by Kleppner and Kolenkow is an example of a textbook used in such courses, as is "Electricity and Magnetism" by Purcell and Morin.

## Undergraduate Years 2-4
Intermediate-level courses using separate textbooks for each subject (e.g. Griffiths for electromagnetism, Taylor for mechanics)
Example 2nd year choices include:
- "Classical Mechanics" by Taylor or "Introduction to Classical Mechanics" by Morin
- "Introduction to Electrodynamics" by Griffiths

Example 3rd year choices include:
- "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics" by Griffiths
- "Statistical Physics"

Example 4th year choices include:
- condensed matter, nuclear physics, particle physics, quantum field theory and general relativity at 4th year
- "Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity" by Hartle


## Graduate (MS/PhD)
Advanced courses using separate textbooks again (e.g. Jackson for electromagnetism, Goldstein for classical mechanics)
